# Titanic_MachineLearning
Kaggle competition - Predict survival on the Titanic using Excel, Python, Random Forests

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

The goal of this competition is to create a model to analyze what sorts of people were likely to survive. Tools of machine learning are used in Python to make this prediction.
